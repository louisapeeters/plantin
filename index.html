          sets off for Caen to learn the noble art of bookbinding as an apprentice. While perfecting his craft, he also
          learns the
          basics of printing and book <strong>selling—skills</strong> that will one day make him famous.</p>
        <p>But for now, it's mostly glue, leather, and the occasional paper cut.
          But life isn't all work and no <strong>play</strong>. In Caen, Christophe meets <strong>Joanna Rivièra</strong>.
          Sparks fly, and soon enough, the two are
          married and welcoming their first <strong>daughter</strong>, Margaretha, into the world. It's a lovely place, if

      <div class="house__text">
        <p>The next morning, Christoffel wakes up with a plan—and probably a black eye. With his bookbinding days behind
          him,
          Christoffel <strong>founds</strong> “Officina Plantiniana”—a printing house equipped with <strong>15
            presses</strong> and a mountain of lead letters of
          20,000 kg. From bookbinder to full-blown businessman, Plantin has officially <strong>upgraded</strong> to a
          force to be reckoned with.</p>
        <p>His first big client? <strong>The Familia Caritatis</strong>—a sect with religious views that then would've
          been politely described as
          “the kind of thing you don't mention at family dinners,” and less politely as “a full-blown theological train
          wreck.”
          While the work kept the presses running at full speed, it also lands Christoffel in <strong>hot water</strong>
          with the deeply Catholic
          community. The sect's “creative” takes on faith don't exactly make them the toast of the town. He quickly
          realises
          that printing is not just lucrative, it's <strong>hazardous</strong> to your social life.</p>

        <strong>illustrations</strong> in these books are extraordinary, what started as a modest 1,309
        <strong>woodcuts</strong> gets cranked up to a staggering
        2,178, because who's counting? These aren't just books; they're the 16th-century equivalent of NFTs—except these
        actually serve a purpose. The books are so <strong>valuable</strong>, uncoloured editions are priced at eight
        guilders, and the
        hand-coloured versions go for an eye-watering <strong>118 guilders</strong>.
        Why the high price? Well, the painstaking manual colouring process adds value, making them a
        <strong>luxury</strong> far beyond the reach
        of your average worker—unless they were paid hush money by the 16th-century version of Donald Trump.

          Through his dedication and craftsmanship, he helped to change the course of <strong>history</strong>, making
