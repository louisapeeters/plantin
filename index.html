    <p class="birth__text">The sun rises over Tours, France, around 1517—though Plantin always insisted it was
      <strong>1520</strong>. "Easier to do the math," he'd
      joke. Baby <strong>Plantin is born</strong>. Life wasn't all sunshine and roses, though in that time. <strong>The
        plague</strong> came around and took
      his mother with him, leaving young Christophe and his father to face the world <strong>alone</strong>. moved them
      to Paris and enrolled
      Christophe at the prestigious <strong>Sorbonne</strong>

      <p>By noon, tragedy strikes again: Christophe's father dies. Young Plantin is now an <strong>orphan</strong> with
        a knack for survival. He
        sets off for Caen to learn the noble art of bookbinding as an apprentice. While perfecting his craft, he also
        learns the
        basics of printing and book <strong>selling—skills</strong> that will one day make him famous.</p>
      <p>But for now, it's mostly glue, leather, and the occasional paper cut.
        But life isn't all work and no <strong>play</strong>. In Caen, Christophe meets <strong>Joanna Rivièra</strong>.
        Sparks fly, and soon enough, the two are
        married and welcoming their first <strong>daughter</strong>, Margaretha, into the world. It's a lovely place, if
        your biggest ambition is
        to own a really nice goat. But Christophe has <strong>bigger plans</strong>, and Caen just isn't cutting it.</p>

      modest <strong>bookshop</strong>. Here, Christophe officially
      rebrands himself as "Christoffel" because when in Rome—or Antwerp—you adapt. Their family grows with the arrival
      of
      their second daughter, <strong>Martina Plantin</strong>. Martina, clearly inheriting her father's knack for smart
      <strong>partnerships</strong> and will
      one day marry <strong>Jan Moretus</strong>, a young apprentice who not only wins her heart but also later will
      take the reins of the
      family business.

    <p>Late at night, while <strong>delivering</strong> an elegant, gilded leather case to the governor, Christoffel is

    <p>The attack leaves him with a <strong>permanently injured</strong> arm, effectively ending his bookbinding career.
      A lesser man might have
      given up, but not Christoffel. If he couldn't bind books, he'd <strong>print</strong> them. <br>
      Around the same time, Christoffel also welcomed yet another daughter, Catharina.</p>

    <h2>Officina Plantiniana</h2>
    <div class="house__text">
      <p>The next morning, Christoffel wakes up with a plan—and probably a black eye. With his bookbinding days behind
        him,
        Christoffel <strong>founds</strong> “Officina Plantiniana”—a printing house equipped with <strong>15
          presses</strong> and a mountain of lead letters of
        20,000 kg. From bookbinder to full-blown businessman, Plantin has officially <strong>upgraded</strong> to a
        force to be reckoned with.</p>
      <p>His first big client? <strong>The Familia Caritatis</strong>—a sect with religious views that then would've
        been politely described as
        “the kind of thing you don't mention at family dinners,” and less politely as “a full-blown theological train
        wreck.”
        While the work kept the presses running at full speed, it also lands Christoffel in <strong>hot water</strong>
        with the deeply Catholic
        community. The sect's “creative” takes on faith don't exactly make them the toast of the town. He quickly
        realises
        that printing is not just lucrative, it's <strong>hazardous</strong> to your social life.</p>

      <p>By midday, things go south. The authorities <strong>raid</strong> Plantin's shop and accuse him of
        <strong>heresy</strong>. Luckily he was in Paris at the
        time. They did however <strong>auctioned off</strong> his printing equipment—because nothing says
        "church-approved" like seizing a man's
        livelihood. However, Plantin's persistence pays off—he manages to <strong>buy back</strong> everything and
        rebuild.
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, his family grows with the births of Magdalena, a feisty <strong>feminist</strong> who gives her
        father endless headaches until
        she's sent off to Paris, and Henrica, his <strong>fifth daughter</strong>?!—because why stop at four? Plantin
        starts to wonder if he's
        running a printing press or a <strong>breeding program</strong>.</p>

    <p class="botanic__text">Plantin pours his energy into the <strong>monumental botanical</strong> and technical
      masterpiece, Dodoens's botanical book. The
      <strong>illustrations</strong> in these books are extraordinary, what started as a modest 1,309
      <strong>woodcuts</strong> gets cranked up to a staggering
      2,178, because who's counting? These aren't just books; they're the 16th-century equivalent of NFTs—except these
      actually serve a purpose. The books are so <strong>valuable</strong>, uncoloured editions are priced at eight
      guilders, and the
      hand-coloured versions go for an eye-watering <strong>118 guilders</strong>.
      Why the high price? Well, the painstaking manual colouring process adds value, making them a
      <strong>luxury</strong> far beyond the reach
      of your average worker—unless they were paid hush money by the 16th-century version of Donald Trump.

        Through his dedication and craftsmanship, he helped to change the course of <strong>history</strong>, making
